Please follow these contributing guidelines for the Source Start event:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the project's repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Pick/Raise an Issue**: Browse the list of issues or create one if you have something in mind. Choose one that matches your expertise and interests. `Raising an Issue before working on it, is of utmost priority. One can begin to work on an issue once assigned by Project Collaborators`
