1. **Minor Bug Fixes and Documentation Issues**: `10 Points`
   - Points will be awarded for identifying and fixing minor bugs and issues in the project's codebase.
   - Documentation improvements, such as clarifications, updates, or fixing typos, will also be rewarded.

2. **Minor Optimizations**: `30 Points`
   - Points will be granted for optimizing code, improving performance, and making minor enhancements to the project.

3. **Adding New Features and Major Changes**: `50 Points`
   - The highest points are reserved for contributors who introduce significant new features or make substantial changes to the project.

Please follow these contributing guidelines for the Source Start event:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the project's repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Pick/Raise an Issue**: Browse the list of issues or create one if you have something in mind. Choose one that matches your expertise and interests. `Raising an Issue before working on it, is of utmost priority. One can begin to work on an issue once assigned by Project Collaborators`

4. **Work on Your Contribution**: Make your changes or improvements locally on your forked repository.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Keep your commits clear and concise. Reference the issue number in your commit message. Follow the best practices for commit messages.

6. **Pull Request (PR)**: Open a pull request from your repository to the Source Start repository. Please ensure that you describe your changes, mentioning the issue your PR addresses.

7. **Code Review**: Expect feedback and be open to making further changes based on code reviews.

8. **Points Award**: Points will be awarded as per the rules and rubrics mentioned above, based on the nature and scope of your contribution.

9. **Be Respectful and Inclusive**: Respect other contributors' ideas, and maintain a friendly and inclusive environment. We encourage diverse perspectives.

10. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on providing valuable contributions rather than aiming for a high point count.

11. **Continuous Learning**: Use this event as an opportunity to learn and grow in your development skills.

12. **Transparency**: If you have any questions or need clarification, don't hesitate to ask. Communication is key.

13. **Have Fun**: Most importantly, have fun, and enjoy the process of contributing to open source!
